This program was developed to stringently call SNPs given bacterial strains sequenced with difference sequencing methods. This pipeline implements the read aligners BWA, LAST and NOVOALIGN.

This program searches the The Pseudomonas Genome Database for information related to a user-input locus tag (e.g PA14_73070). I wrote this code because I wanted to obtain the PseudoCAP functional annotation for more than a few loci. The retrieved information will be printed on screen in the json format.
